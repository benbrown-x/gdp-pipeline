# Running the Demo Pipeline

This should be all that's necessary to run what I've set up so far, if not
poke me and insist that I be better.

    apt-get install vagrant

From the root of this repo run:

    vagrant up

Once it's finished spinning up you should have a shiny looking webpage at
192.168.100.4:8080.

Download the fly CLI from the above webpage and put it somewhere sensible
(make sure it's executable) and run the following (replacing variables
with useful entries):

    fly set-pipeline -p demo-pipeline -c pipeline.yml \
      --var "test_key=$(cat concourse.key)"
    fly unpause-pipeline -p demo-pipeline

The webpage will be updated with some more shiny stuff.
